# Covid Data Exploratory Analysis

In this Data Exploratory Analysis of a COVID-19 dataset (collected on Sept 13,2021), we will be looking at different queries to gain as much insight as possible and work our way through the numbers. 

This is my first EDA project, so I decided to follow a tutorial to see how exactly data analysis works and basically learn to think like an analyst. To be very honest, when I viewed the dataset at first, I was over-whelmed by its size and the amount of data available. But the tutorial helped me resize, exclude unncessary information and realise what exactly a data analyst must be able to do for starters. 

This tutorial is by [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7cs8q-gJRlGwj4A8OmCmXg), he also has many more videos that may help aspiring data analysts, so I urge you to check him out. And as for the tutorial we are currently talking about, you'll find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&index=2&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst)




## What exactly did we explore?

As we all know, COVID-19 has shaken up normal life as we know it, so I thought it was fitting and most relevant to start my data analyst career by exploring a COVID-19 dataset. The dataset, unsurprisingly, had a huge amount of data to work with, but since it is my exploratory project I didn't focus on cleaning it beforehand. You can find the up-to-date dataset [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

The exploration was basic and simple so as a beginner I had no problems following and understanding what was being done. We obtain and calculate few relavent conclusions and numbers. The SQL queries for the above can be found in this repository, feel free to add more to it when you do your project if you are comfortable. 




## Data Visualization In Tableau

I've never done anything on Tableau before, so this was completely new. But with the help of the tutorial I was able to find my way around it and even try some new things myself, so it shouldn't be a problem for you if you are an absolute beginner! We used the same datasets but different queries to collect data for our visualization, you can find the queries in this repository. 

As for the Tableau dashboard, I had incredible fun doing it and I hope you enjoy it as well!! You can find mine [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/varsha3237/viz/CovidAnalysis_16317635854240/Dashboard1?publish=yes) in case you'd like to see how your project will turn out (feel free to make it better :P )





So that was the gist of my first data analysis project, please don't hesitate to let me know if I can improve on it. Hope you found what you were looking for!
